# Magic Trick

An audience member selects 5 cards from an ordinary 52 card deck, memorizes
them, and then shows them to the magician's assistant.  The assistant returns
one card to the audience member, and hands the other 4 to the magician.  The
magician tells the audience member what the fifth card is.

## Code
This is implemented as functions to decode a set of 4, encode a set of 5, and
to encode a single held out card.
